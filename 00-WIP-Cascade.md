# Embrace the cascade

Two groups argue about styling: the CSS files people and the Tailwind users. Now and then, some blog posts hit pieces are written to try to convince the other side that they are wrong and should see the light.
This post is not one of those; I want to showcase the shortcomings and wins of both sides and explain why I'm personally looking for a more middle-ground approach.

## Biases

Before we start, I would like to disclose my biases to provide some context for the post:

- I mainly write CSS in the context of design systems. As an application developer, I don't want to have to make micro-decisions about styling on every element.
- I like CSS; I studied CSS Zen Garden (Kyoto Gardens being the superior theme) back in the day, and I believe it's a fantastic language.
- I never found a home in BEM. Just like Tailwind, it deprives you of the cascade/specificity.
- I appreciate what TypeScript has done for the JavaScript ecosystem. I like types.
- I'm a little burned out by refactoring styles from one system to another or living in hybrid-styled products that implement styles in a few different ways.
- Stitches is currently my preferred way of stylingâ€”mostly there, but not maintained anymore.
- I created a proof of concept for a statically extracted styling library.

## Benchmarks

The elephants in the room are benchmarks. I will explore this aspect in a follow-up post, as it's a difficult topic and we should always take one-dimensional or micro-benchmarks with a grain of salt.
For now, I would like to ask you what threshold you consider relevant for performance differences. What kind of performance are you looking for (at compile time, initial load, re-paints)?
Make sure to mark those numbers somewhere, like in the comments (hi, engagement bait), and we'll revisit this with data at a later time. I would like you to come with an open mind and hear my arguments without the "utility is always faster" or "CSS files are the only way" mindsets. In the search for greatness, sometimes we may forget what is good.

## Setting the Table

One last stop before we start: I would like to define a few things to ensure we are speaking about the same concepts:

- CSS files: This includes any kind of manual CSS assignment, straight .css files, SASS, SCSS, Stylus, and CSS modules (controversial pick right there).
- Atomic libraries: Any library that relies on utility class names, where the style composition happens in the HTML. Think of Tailwind, Panda, Stylex, etc.
- Runtime CSS-in-JS: Any styling libraries that generate stylesheets on the client. If these libraries allow for runtime string interpolation, my experience tends to suggest that they get abused.
- Statically extracted: CSS-in-JS where the styles are generated at build time. Once generated, it is virtually equivalent to CSS files.
- CSS-in-TS: Essentially CSS-in-JS but with type safety as a first-class citizen, whether it's at runtime or build time.

## CSS Files and its Bear Traps

CSS files are my first love. I used CSS, SASS, and then CSS modules (SCSS modules, actually) pretty exclusively early in my career. Life was good and simple.
Why would a CSS enthusiast like myself be pushed to CSS-in-JS? Alright, here's how you do not make friends (1/3)

As soon as the projects I worked on became bigger, involved more "legacy code," or just had more contributors, some serious bear traps started to appear everywhere.

People will immediately mention the lack of collocation of styles and markup as the most problematic drawback of CSS files. I can see this argument and mostly agree that it improves the developer experience significantly, but my main concerns are more about safety, intent communication, DRY, and maintenance.

### Safety

The main weakness of CSS, to me, is that everything is matched against strings. Whenever you get into CSS land, it feels like you are downgrading from TypeScript to JavaScript.
Unless you use a battery of tools, you get no LSP (Language Server Protocol) telling you that this class does not exist or that the CSS variable token has a typo. When no errors are thrown, you have to rely on your eyes, manual testing, and the style inspector.
CSS-in-TS helps you here; just make sure you have a proper library, and you'll never have to worry about this whole class of mistakes. This is the reason why I also prefer the object notation (e.g., backgroundColor: 'blue') over the CSS string-based libraries.
You can then rely on TypeScript introspection to ensure all of your styles are sound, with no external tools required (assuming you are already using TypeScript; more on that later).

### Intent Communication

Once you reach a certain threshold, it becomes very difficult to know what has been designed to be reused, what requires a copy-paste, or what can be a simple additional selector added to a rule. By extension, it makes it difficult to know where things are used and the blast radius of a change.

### DRY

As a corollary of the previous point, having access to the whole CSS file declaration, people tend to be tempted to avoid repeating themselves. To save a few bytes, styles become more and more complex, not because the styling needs to be more complex, but because we introduce a lot of style coupling rather than simply copying and pasting. There is a way to achieve this properly; more on that later.

### Maintenance

CSS is very freeform, and that's a good thing. You can build it as complex as you want or need. But at some point, a new contributor shows up and, either due to a lack of context, knowledge, skill, or time, starts meticulously breaking every rule you have set, and the tug-of-war begins. If you've worked at a place with multiple contributors, you've most likely seen stuff like:

- .wrapper.wrapper.wrapper {} to artificially boost specificity
- A few !important declarations here and there
- Classes impacting children 4, 5, 6, or more nesting levels below (or worse, no direct nesting relations specified).
- People relying on unrelated parts of the styles (think a #root div {} rule). Refactoring those less specific rules always comes with a fair share of breaking unrelated styles.
- A bunch of deprecated classes that no one removes because it's scary and might break something completely unrelated.

If the only way to apply styles is to stand up the application and visually check that nothing else applies to your elements in the inspect tool, your styling solution is not working for you; you are working against it.
Unless you have a full visual regression test suite or a very small amount of styles, you are most likely using CSS as an append-only ledger; you add code to the bottom of the file and pray you didn't break anything.
In this world of CSS-in-JS/TS, eliminating dead code is the same as in the rest of your application: find unused exports and cull them. If you overdo it, the build breaks. This approach is far more welcoming for new contributors and helps prevent the growing layers of eras of styling in a project.

## Previous-gen CSS-in-JS

Ok, it's now time to move on to the trendy styling library of the day, part of it was curiosity, and part of it was buying into the big developer experience wins. If you need some styles, just declare a new component, and you're off to the race.
I start to encounter a few hard walls quite quickly. I'm now convinced runtime libraries promote bad practices and should be avoided (how you do not make friends 2/3).

### Performance

Using react and buying into the whole "re-rendering is fine" mindset. Runtime libraries need to recompute styles all the time. Modifying the color prop on the element, let's blow the whole class up and regenerate a new one on the fly during the render loop. More styled components mean more unnecessary calculations. We'll see with the benchmark how bad it is, but my experience tends to suggest this is the only period of my dev career that I had to worry about styling performance.

### Un-necessary DOM nesting
Now that we have a Wrapper component, let's import that everywhere and wrap everything because HTML nodes are free, right?
I've seen <Text> components as a series of nested components where each nesting level was hypernormalized in the name of composability (think <Wrapper><Flex><Alert>). In a way, this is recreating the atomic paradigm with extra HTML nodes.

=> include Example

### Losing touch with the HTML
Somewhat related to the previous point. When you start creating those generic components, the HTML is slowly sidestepping away.
This is how you get divs inside buttons that are within spans. It technically works but creates a mess. You might not care because *it works*, but I do.

=> include Example

### Extending styles is rough
Do we need class inheritance in our CSS?
const SuperWrapper = styled(Wrapper)``. Not a fan.

### Theming is rough
Creating themes is defined via a kind of global object. It works well in small situations (even if not the most performant). What always ends up happening is you start using part of the theme as props to respond to different logic. If this is a primary button, pass the theme.primary.text as the color prop to the component. This means runtime evaluation of the styles (performance again), this means wrapping your parent component in a withTheme HoC (performance once again), and leaking styles into the logic.
There's a way to solve this if you are strict about it, like enforcing generic props to drive variance (more on that later). That would be setting a prop as role: 'Primary' | 'Secondary' | 'neutral' and doing the theme switching in the style declaration. In practice, people will take the shortcut and

=> include Example

### Type safety is rough
Most of those libraries rely on manually annotating the allowed styles styled.div<{role: 'Primary' | 'Secondary' | 'neutral'}>`...`, This once again technically works but is an extra step that doesn't have to exist (the function has all the information it needs to infer the types), and in practice gets skipped quite often and you are back with a big `any` on the props.

=> include Example

### Debugging is rough
As someone who often looks at the raw HTML and jumps between sections of the markup there, the barrage of generated class names makes my life so much harder.
Those class names are also difficult to trace back in breadcrumbs bug reports like sentry, user clicked on `div.kj98 > button.ga45.ew84`, cool cool cool.
Same for targeting elements in the E2E testing environment, not that you should use those, but it's nice to have them available in some situations.

## Jumping on the tailwind boat

A lot of the success of Tailwind, I believe, is due to the lack of good alternatives to author styles nicely with limited chances to burn yourselves. For all application development purposes, Tailwind may be already past the goal post. As a design system guy, I still have a few gripes with it (how you do not make friends 3/3).

### New syntax
The weakest argument there is that it feels wrong to learn a new DSL (even if it's just text) that compiles back to the one you already know. Meh

### Tools required
To have a good time using Tailwind, you need to get some extra tooling in place.
- The class name ordering extension is a must, more on that very soon.
- The watcher to build your style as you author them. Over the years, the compiler has become better and better. But due to how tailwind works, it's difficult to ensure it works 100% of the time in edge case scenarios like interpolated class names, etc.
- At some point, you will need something like CVA and/or tw-merge, more on that later.

### Nerfing your CSS.
Losing specificity and the cascade means working with a less capable tool. This is a trade-off to get a simpler, more direct styling. Some will find this trade-off beneficial.

#### Styling at a distance
This is dangerous to go alone on this one, but crafting design systems with styling at a distance is great for communication of intentions.
- In design systems, you often need to target direct children, :after/before pseudo-elements, and so on.
- Modifying the styles depending on the context of the element. As long as you make sure to always define it on the affected selector, life will be good.
``` No bueno
.alert {
background: red;
color:white;
& .button.delete: {
text:red;
background:white;
}
}
```
``` bueno
.button.delete {
background: red;
color:white;
.alert &: {
text:red;
background:white;
}
}
```


#### Specificity
When using tailwind, the order you define conflicting classes in HTML has little to do with how your HTML nodes will be styled. After all, Tailwind and other atomic CSS libraries are *just CSS*; they need to abide by the same rules. The last declared class in the CSS file is the one that wins (and that file is written by someone else).
Two options are open to you as an atomic user: Use a tool in your editor to order the classes in the same order as the CSS (what Tailwind does, and admittedly will help gzip compress better your HTML), and/or introduce runtime de-duplication (performance!?) like Panda/StyleX or CVA/tw-merge for Tailwind.
All of this is handled by the specificity rules in regular CSS: Let's introduce now an unnamed semantic CSS library: `.button` is the main style definition; `.button.importance-primary` can be a variant; `.button.importance-primary.flag-disabled` can be a compound variant. The styling engine in your browser handles all of that for you simply, automatically, and quickly. Atomic styling can't do that.

=> include Example


### Working with already styled libraries/components

When you import components that include their styles, overwriting styles becomes tricky when your styling solution is willfully bailing out of using specificity.
Thankfully, this may become less and less of a problem with the explosion of unstyled component libraries and "copy/paste the source code into your codebase" like shadcn ui.

=> include Example

### coloration of your styles/lack of coloration
When you are building a design system, you can set how people are going to interface with it. Inside a company, you can control the use of specific tools to make sure everything works nicely together, and limit the context switching between different libraries and patterns.
Facebook, for instance, chose to use StyleX for its design system and everything styling-related. The problem with this approach is that now, you have to use styleX for everything CSS-related forever. This is what I would call the coloration of your styles.
In the same vein, when your design system relies on Panda or Tailwind (with tw-merge and/or CVA), if you want to keep the safety of being able to inject your styles on the application side, you do have to use the corresponding library.
On the opposite side of the same coin, if you use another styling solution, you open yourselves to surprises depending on your setup, like which stylesheet gets declared last.
One of the newer CSS additions, CSS layers, can help address this problem quite directly (and enable the variant-first styling patterns). It becomes trivial to have your design system styles, and allow any other styles applied to gracefully override yours without fighting specificity, nesting, and so on. More on that later.

=> include Example

### CSS moving target

Nothing prevents Tailwind from adopting CSS layers (even if the atomic nature would work against itself there). CSS anchor positioning, :has and :is, and a slew of new features are/will be dropping into browsers. In some ways, the CSS winter being over means a lot of work to maintain (atomic) styling libraries.
Each new feature requires the Tailwind team (and other libraries like it) to implement it in their tools. This means in practice that the library is never "finished" and will always be in flux. Also means you have to wait for it to be in the library to use. Maybe once again, it's a good thing it protects you from yourselves. I like using @supports rules personally to give a little better experience to some of my users / try out features being flags.


## Last stepping stone
As mentioned before, I'm using stitches as my main styling library nowadays. It solves most of the issues mentioned above. But the company maintaining it got sold and is now been unmaintained for a few years. Still, because it uses very standard CSS, I can work around most of its quirks by just declaring a little CSS here and there.

### Variant-first API is the way
As mentioned before, using specificity in CSS to handle variance is simple, clear, and fast. barely any runtime costs.
It also makes reading the styles extremely clear and prevents extending styles for no reason. If styles are related but different, they might just be variants (insert Loki joke).
Discoverability of styles is greater; use your LSP to see what's available.
TypeScript has a field day inferring props.
With the adoption of CSS layers into all the major browsers, the output of a variant first library becomes extremely flexible. It includes multiple layers for the base styles, the variants, the compound variants, and for the application to overwrite them. In practice, this means you can use Tailwind or any other library or your own CSS classes to overwrite the styles of components created by such a library.
=> include Example

### Theming done right
All the theme tokens are defined as CSS variables. Open for anyone to use/modify/override as you see fit. Dark theme? Sure, just define CSS variables under an @media query. Prefer using the color-scheme, Sure, go ahead.
=> include Example

### We're in the endgame now
If using an unmaintained library for more than 2 years without major issues isn't a sign that we're finally getting to a stable place, I don't know what is.
A new feature drops into CSS; browsers support it; just update your TS definitions and we can use it.

## Finally reaching the end goal post

The last remaining hurdles when you are using stitches are:
- keeping up with React and other front-end libraries/frameworks. Stitches breaks with RSC, for instance.
- The exported type definitions are not ideal (and quite slow to infer).

### Static extraction
Static extraction turns your CSS-in-JS library into static CSS files that your bundler can now bundle however it wants. This solves the 2 previously mentioned
- CSS module injections: Already working with RSC, and generative UIs as those workflows are used by the static CSS people.
- Types just need to know about variants, actual runtime only adds a few class names to the HTML nodes, the rest is generated at build time.

### Libraries

Some libraries to statically extract CSS-in-JS are
- vanilla extract
- linaria
- Pigment

But the tooling to build one yourself and do what you want is getting quite accessible at a rapid pace.
- Parcel Macros allows you to run Javascript at build time to write CSS files and attach them to your bundler of choice. Inspired by bun macros and zig comp-time.
- CSS lightning lets you not worry about minification, vendor prefixing, and all of that.
- WyW-in-JS is a framework to build statically extracted libraries.

Using libraries like this removes a significant portion of the work and lets the author focus on what's important: the API (and by extension DX) and the trade-off between complexity and capabilities that fit their needs.

I hope to see an explosion of solutions, all targeting a slightly different niche use case. May the best/most generic/better-weighted trade-off win.

For instance, using Parcel Macros and Lightning CSS, associated with dumb CSS generation, means you are keeping up with CSS for close to near-zero upkeep. Such a library could be written in a couple hundred lines of code (less if you want to keep typescript out of the loop).
